# Netflix-GPT

Created this Project called NetflixGPT.  A Netflix clone that provides users with a familiar interface to browse movies. The application is integrated with TMDB to fetch movie details and with Firebase for authentication. Users can watch trailers on YouTube by clicking on a movie. Additionally, there's a section for specialized movie suggestions, where users can search the movies using OpenAI API  and get the results.
